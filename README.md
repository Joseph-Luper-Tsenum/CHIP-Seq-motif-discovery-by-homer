# CHIP-Seq motif discovery by homer for chromosome 18 of the human genome 

### Introduction

Chromosome 18 of the human genome was used for CHIP-Seq motif discovery by homer


### PART I

#### SOX2 analysis:

The following Motifs homer were found from our SOX2 analysis. Only the first five motifs have been shown here.

From our SOX2 analysis, there was no similar motif as our known SOX2 motif, even though some motifs looks like s our known SOX2 motif, an example is the 6th motif in the result

### PART II

#### RMST Analysis:

Following Motifs homer were found from our RMST analysis. Only the first five motifs have been shown here.

From our RMST analysis, there was no similar motif as our known SOX2 motif, even though some motifs looks like s our known SOX2 motif, an example is the 6th motif in the result.

### Conclusion

• There was no similar SOX2 motif found for both SOX2 and RMST analysis.

• Randomly, chromosome (chr18) of the human genome was used, and even though the required result did not turn out, there are motifs that are very close to being similar to our known SOX2 motif, meaning that if we consider only one chromosome, it can still produce a similar or nearly similar results. 


The same process was repeated for Chromosome 19, but there was no motif was discovered as being similar to our known SOX2 motif.
